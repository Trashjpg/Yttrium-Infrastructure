# Yttrium-Infrastructure
Yttrium (WIP) is a infrastructure for Roblox based on creating classes and creating easier Remote Event connections


To start just paste the script into a module script in roblox and `require` it from both the client and the server.
Using the global variable `_G.Yttrium` you will be able to call the functions in that script
